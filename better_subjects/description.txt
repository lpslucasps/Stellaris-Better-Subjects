This mod adds two new policy trees called Subjects Taxation and Subjects Support, that gives you the possibility to tax or subside your Vassals or Protectorates (or both).

With the Subjects Taxation policies, you can turn your Vassals and Protectorates into Tributary Vassals and Tributary Protectorates, respectively. They act just like their normal counterparts, but give you 10% of their montlhy income in Energy Credits and Minerals. But be careful: they'll not be happy about this new situation and you will receive a severe relationship penalty with them (-75 for vassals, -50 for protectorates).

If you're feeling magnanimous, you can instead subsidize your subjects with the Subjects Support policies. Vassals can receive a bonus to Energy Credits and Minerals production, while Protectorates will have their scientific progress greatly improved. These policies will cost you money and science, but will make your subjects much more loyal to you.

[*]Exclusive events based on your policies with your subjects[/list]

[h1]LIMITATIONS[/h1]
[list][*]Empires vassalized after the policy change and protectorates that become vassals will take around 1 month to become Tributary Vassals. Think of this as the time your government needs to implement tax collection on gallactic levels.
[*]There's no way to discriminate between subjects. The policies changes apply to all of them. Be careful.[/list]

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
[list][*]There's no icons for Tributary Vassals and Tributary Protectorates in the Diplomacy and Contacts screens. It seems the icons for those screens are hardcoded. If someone finds a way to add new icons, please, contact me![/list]

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

This mod should be compatible with games in progress.

This mod modifies the file common\diplomatic_actions\00_actions.txt, so there may be incompatibilities with mods that use the same file. The fixes implemented by the Unofficial Asimov Hotfix are already included.
